- üî∂ *maybe harmful -- deprecation, or possible breaking change*
- üçè *harmless -- addition, fix, or enhancement*

<br/>

## v0.7

### 0.7.7
- üî∂ deprecate `Radians.to` and `Radians.from`
  - `Radians.to.degrees(3.14)` becomes `Radians.toDegrees(3.14)`
  - `Radians.from.degrees(180)` becomes `Degrees.toRadians(180)`
  - similar pattern as new `Degrees.toRadians` with new `Turns.toRadians` and `Arcseconds.toRadians`

### v0.7.0 to v0.7.6
- üçè **new math2**
  - vector math, scalar math, etc, it's all been redone
  - the old math has been deprecated
  - to keep using the old deprecated math, for now,
    - change imports like `import {vec3} from "@benev/toolbox"`
    - to `import {vec3} from "@benev/toolbox/x/math/exports.js"`
  - to use the new math, import the new utilities
    - `import {Vec3, Scalar, Randy} from "@benev/toolbox"`
  - i'm not gonna document every change so read the source
  - but i will say:
    - the new vector classes are objects with methods, allowing us to use nicer chaining syntax
    - all methods will operate on the values *in-place* which is a bold move
    - i wanted the chainability, but it's also a serious performance concern to not clutter the gc with bazillions of stupid vector objects
    - you need to use `.clone()` when you wanna make a copy of something
